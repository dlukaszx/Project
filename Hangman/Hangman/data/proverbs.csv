when in Rome
why keep a dog and bark yourself
you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
mighty oaks from little acorns grow
mind over matter
money is the root of all evil
appearances are deceptive
birds of a feather flock together
discretion is the better part of valor
birds of the feather flock together
discretion is the better part of valour
opposites attract
tempus fugit
the pen is mightier than the sword
all things come to those who wait
hydrate or diedrate
underpromise and overdeliver
care killed the cat
hunger is a good sauce
possession is nine points of the law
procrastination is the thief of time
you get more with a kind word and a gun than you do with a kind word alone
mess with the bull and you get the horns
hunger is the best sauce
wanton kittens make sober cats
hunger is the best spice
you get what you pay for
short reckonings make long friends
silence is golden
the proof is in the pudding
the proof of the pudding is in the eating
finders keepers
fools rush in where angels fear to tread
do unto others as you would have them do unto you
measure twice and cut once
money talks
take time by the forelock
money talks and bullshit walks
out of the mouths of babes
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
talk is cheap
patience is a virtue
perfect is the enemy of good
them that has gets
you make the bed you lie in
necessity is the mother of innovation
them what has gets
necessity is the mother of invention
necessity knows no law
still water runs deep
still waters run deep
a bad carpenter blames his tools
a bad penny always comes back
you never miss the water until the well runs dry
great haste makes great waste
a bad penny always turns up
you only get what you give
a bad tree does not yield good apples
doctors make the worst patients
haters gonna hate
the sky is the limit
a bad workman always blames his tools
you pays your money and you takes your choice
the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
zeal without knowledge is a runaway horse
children should be seen and not heard
charity begins at home
to each his own
give a man a fish
to err is human
use it or lose it
"give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
this too shall pass
you snooze you lose
this too shall pass away
yesterday is gone
dead men can tell no tales
only fools and horses work
dead men tell no tales
in vino veritas
fine feathers make fine birds
many a mickle makes a muckle
the tongue wounds more than a lance
different strokes for different folks
the truth is in the wine
a buck is a buck
only Nixon can go to China
every cloud has a silver lining
great minds
a buck is a buck is a buck
only Nixon could go to China
revenge is a dish best served cold
every dark cloud has a silver lining
practice makes perfect
good things come to those who wait
great minds think alike
only the good die young
many hands make light work
every day is a school day
fine words butter no parsnips
a burnt child dreads the fire
make hay while the sun shines
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
the wheel turns
every dog has his day
a camel is a horse designed by a committee
every dog has its day
a camel is a horse made by a committee
every dog must have his day
every dog must have its day
even a blind pig can find an acorn once in a while
great oaks from little acorns grow
the whistle does not pull the train
every Jack has his Jill
a cat can look at a king
chicks before dicks
even Homer nods
every king needs a queen
good wine needs no bush
a cat in gloves catches no mice
make it do or do without
a cat may look at a king
heaven helps those that help themselves
even Jove nods
every little helps
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
heaven helps those who help themselves
a change is as good as a rest
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
ladies first
every man has a price
April showers bring May flowers
beauty is only skin deep
speak of the devil and he appears
a closed mouth catches no flies
sow the wind and reap the whirlwind
a closed mouth gathers no feet
a contented mind is a perpetual feast
nothing succeeds like success
speak softly and carry a big stick
every rose has a thorn
every rose has its thorn
every rule has an exception
seeing is believing
let a thousand flowers bloom
a danger foreseen is half avoided
old sins cast long shadows
early bird catches the worm
every silver lining has a cloud
old sins have long shadows
no gain without pain
manners maketh man
take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves
seek and ye shall find
a drowning man will clutch at a straw
take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves
clogs to clogs in three generations
a dumb priest never got a parish
ignorance is bliss
turnabout is fair play
no good deed ever goes unpunished
respice finem
no good deed goes unpunished

proverbs should go in pairs
a friend in need is a friend indeed
brevity is the soul of wit
union is strength
what goes around comes around
empty vessels make the most sound
throw enough mud at the wall and some of it will stick
what goes up must come down
what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas
first catch your hare
never change a running system
a golden key can open any door
what happens on the road stays on the road
union makes strength
a good beginning makes a good ending
what happens on tour stays on tour
loose lips sink ships
the apple does not fall far from the stem
ignore all rules
what has been seen cannot be unseen
the apple does not fall far from the tree
the apple does not fall far from the trunk
to the victor go the spoils
a good deed is its own reward
there are bad apples in every orchard
to thine own self be true
the apple never falls far from the tree
there are many ways to skin a cat
the apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest
there are no atheists in foxholes
there are none so blind as those who will not see

there are plenty more fish in the sea

there are plenty of fish in the sea
kids will be kids
the bad penny always turns up
there are two sides to every question
slow and steady wins the race
never put off until tomorrow what you can do today
a hit dog will holler
forewarned is forearmed
no man is an island
sticks in a bundle are unbreakable
a house divided against itself cannot stand
carpe diem
there but for the grace of God go I

there is an exception to every rule

fortune favors the bold
knowing is half the battle
those who have get more
fortune favors the brave
love is blind
fortune favours the bold
haste makes waste
there is nothing new under the sun
honey catches more flies than vinegar
fortune favours the brave
one cannot break a stick in a bundle
there is reason in the roasting of eggs
those who live in glass houses should not throw stones
one cannot break a twig in a bundle
there is safety in numbers
nearly never bulled a cow
sunlight is the best disinfectant
one cannot break sticks in a bundle
there is strength in numbers
tomorrow is another day
cool heads must prevail
tomorrow never comes
cool heads prevail
experience is the best teacher
cool heads will prevail
caveat lector
there may be snow on the rooftop but there is fire in the furnace
Christmas comes but once a year
